\chapter{Citations}
Our bibliography file looks like
\VerbatimInput[frame=leftline]{willowtreebook.bib}
We can cite works from the bibliography, like Homer~\cite{Homer:Iliad}, p. 12.

\section{Theorems}
You have the usual theorem environments, like \texttt{amsthm}.
\begin{theorem}[Pythagoras]
In any triangle with sides of lengths \(a,b,c\), \(a^2+b^2=c^2\) just when the angle opposite the side of length \(c\) is a right angle.
\end{theorem}

\section{Examples}
I often want to present an example, and make clear where it starts and stops.
\begin{example}
The integral
\[
\int e^{x^2}x\,dx
\]
is evaluated by substituting \(u=x^2\), so
\[
\int e^{x^2}x\,dx=\int e^u \frac{du}{2}.
\]
\end{example}

\section{Preambles}
We can put some \LaTeX{} code before the hints:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
\RenewDocumentCommand\hintsPreamble{}{
\par\noindent{}
\textit{When you are describing, \\
A shape, or sound, or tint; \\
Don't state the matter plainly, \\
But put it in a hint; \\
And learn to look at all things, \\
With a sort of mental squint.}
\par\noindent{}---\ {Lewis Carroll}}
\end{Verbatim}

or before the bibliography:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
\RenewDocumentCommand\bibliographyPreamble{}{
\par\noindent
\textit{If those books are in agreement with the Quran,
we have no need of them;
and if these are opposed to the Quran,
destroy them.}
